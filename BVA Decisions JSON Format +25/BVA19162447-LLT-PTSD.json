    "text": "Citation Nr: 19162447\r\nDecision Date: 08/13/19\tArchive Date: 08/12/19\r\n\r\nDOCKET NO. 15-35 493A\r\nDATE: August 13, 2019\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nEntitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, toinclude posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), is granted.\r\n\r\nREMANDED\r\n\r\nEntitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss is remanded.\r\n\r\nFINDING OF FACT\r\n\r\nResolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran’s favor, he has a diagnosis of PTSD that is etiologically related to an in-service stressor event.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nThe criteria for service connection for PTSD have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107 (2012); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.159, 3.303, 3.304(f) (2018).\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran served on active duty from September 1981 to September 1984.\r\n\r\nThis matter comes before the Board of Veterans’ Appeals (Board) on appeal from an October 2013 rating decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in New York, New York. \r\n\r\nThe Veteran’s October 2015 VA Form 9 contains a request for a hearing before a Veterans Law Judge (VLJ); however, the Veteran withdrew his request, through his attorney, in a November 2018 written statement.\r\n\r\nEntitlement to service connection for PTSD is granted.\r\n\r\nA veteran is entitled to VA disability compensation if there is a disability resulting from personal injury suffered or disease contracted in the line of duty in active service, or for aggravation of a preexisting injury suffered or disease contracted in the line of duty in active service.  38 U.S.C. § 1110.  \r\n\r\nGenerally, to establish a right to compensation for a present disability, a veteran must show: (1) a present disability; (2) an in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service, the so-called “nexus” requirement.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).\r\n\r\nService connection means the facts, shown by evidence, establish that a particular injury or disease resulting in disability was incurred coincident with service, or if preexisting such service, was aggravated by service.  This may be accomplished by affirmatively showing inception or aggravation during service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).\r\n\r\nService connection may be granted for disability shown after service, when all of the evidence, including that pertinent to service, shows that it was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).\r\n\r\n38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f) sets forth requirements for establishing service connection for PTSD, separate from the general requirements for establishing service connection.  See Arzio v. Shinseki, 602 F.3d 1343, 1347 (Fed. Cir. 2010).  Establishing service connection for PTSD requires: (1) medical evidence establishing a diagnosis of the condition in accordance with 38 C.F.R. § 4.125(a); (2) credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor occurred; and (3) medical evidence of a causal nexus between current symptomatology and the specific claimed in-service stressor.  38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f).\r\n\r\nFor stressors unrelated to combat, such as the Veteran’s alleged stressor in this case, credible supporting evidence is necessary in order to grant service connection.  “Credible supporting evidence” of a non-combat stressor may be obtained from service records or other sources.  Moreau v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 389 (1996).  The Court has held that the regulatory requirement for “credible supporting evidence” means that “the appellant’s testimony, by itself, cannot, as a matter of law, establish the occurrence of a noncombat stressor.”  Dizoglio.  Therefore, a veteran’s lay testimony is insufficient, standing alone, to establish service connection.  Cohen at 147 (citing Moreau at 395).\r\n\r\nThe Veteran asserts that his PTSD is due to witnessing his friend and fellow soldier’s accidental death while on active duty service.  Specifically, the Veteran described an incident where he and his friend were preparing for a training exercise when his friend slipped and hit his head.  He was transported to the hospital where he ultimately succumbed to his head injury.  The Veteran was able to provide the name of the soldier, the general cause of death, and the date of the soldier’s death.  In a July 2015 memorandum, the RO was able to confirm the death of the soldier but was unable to corroborate the unit the soldier belonged to or whether the Veteran actually witnessed the incident.  For these reasons, the RO denied the Veteran’s claim due to an unverified stressor. \r\n\r\nAs noted above, the Veteran’s details as to the time, place, and circumstances surrounding the death of the soldier have been verified.  Additionally, the Veteran’s report of his in-service stressor has been unwavering during the course of the appeal, which only adds further credibility to his account.  As such, the Board affords the Veteran the benefit of doubt and the occurrence of an in-service stressor is conceded. \r\n\r\nNext, two private mental health examinations of record indicate that the Veteran is diagnosed with PTSD that is related to his in-service stressor of witnessing his friend, a fellow soldier, accidentally hit his head and die.  In a January 2015 examination, Dr. P. F. noted that the Veteran witnessed the death of a close friend during his military service and determined that the Veteran met the criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, of the American Psychiatric Association (DSM-IV).  In a January 2019 examination, Dr. J. A. found that the Veteran met the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) based protocol requirements for a diagnosis of PTSD based upon an incident in service where the Veteran witnessed the serious injury and death of a fellow soldier who was a friend of his. \r\n\r\nAs the Veteran has a diagnosis of PTSD that is linked to a conceded in-service stressor, the Board finds that service connection for PTSD is warranted.  Accordingly, the claim is granted. \r\n\r\nREASONS FOR REMAND\r\n\r\nEntitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss is remanded.\r\n\r\nFollowing the most recent August 2015 statement of the case (SOC), a July 2019 VA examination was conducted for the Veteran’s hearing loss and tinnitus.  A supplemental statement of the case (SSOC) must be furnished to the Veteran and his attorney when additional pertinent evidence is received after a SOC or after the most recent SSOC.  38 C.F.R. §§ 19.31, 19.37.  As this record is pertinent to the issue regarding the Veteran’s claim of entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss, a remand for consideration of this evidence and issuance of a SSOC is required.\r\n\r\nThe matter is REMANDED for the following action:\r\n\r\nReadjudicate the Veteran’s claim based on the entirety of the evidence.  If any benefit sought remains denied, furnish the Veteran and his attorney a SSOC which considers all evidence added since the August 2015 SOC and return the case to the Board.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nKRISTI L. GUNN\r\n\r\nVeterans Law Judge\r\n\r\nBoard of Veterans’ Appeals\r\n\r\nAttorney for the Board\tL. Silverblatt, Associate Counsel\r\n\r\nThe Board’s decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential, and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303. \r\n\r\n"
