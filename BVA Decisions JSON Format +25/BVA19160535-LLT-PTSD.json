A prior June 2012 rating decision also denied service connection for PTSD and became final. In July 2014, the Veteran requested filed a claim to reopen service connection for PTSD. The October 2014 rating decision reopened the claim, but denied service connection for PTSD on the merits. The Veteran timely filed a January 2015 notice of disagreement. A statement of the case was issued February 2016, and the Veteran substantively appealed in March 2016. The appeal was certified to the Board in December 2016, and the Veteran received a Board hearing in April 2019. This matter now is timely before the Board for disposition.   \r\n\r\nThe Board here recharacterizes the service connection claim, claimed as PTSD, to include diagnosed psychiatric disorders other than PTSD, namely, depressive disorder and anxiety disorder. See Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1 (2009) (holding that a claim for benefits for one psychiatric disability also encompassed benefits based on other psychiatric diagnoses and should be considered by the Board to be within the scope of the filed claim).\r\n\r\nDuties to Notify and Assist\r\n\r\nThe Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 (VCAA) and implementing regulations impose obligations on VA to provide claimants with notice and assistance. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5102, 5103, 5103A, 5107, 5126; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.159, 3.326(a). \r\n\r\nThe Veteran’s representative requested an examination with VA nexus opinion on the question of nexus between currently diagnosed depression and anxiety and service. While a VA examination or opinion regarding the theory of direct service connection for depression and anxiety has not been provided, no VA examination or medical opinion is needed in this case. As explained above, the weight of the evidence demonstrates no in-service psychological disease, injury, or event, including no stressor and no credible evidence of psychological symptoms. The weight of the evidence also demonstrates no symptoms until years after service. There is no reasonable possibility that a medical examination or medical opinion would help substantiate the appeal because there is no in-service injury or disease to which an opinion could relate the currently diagnosed depression or anxiety. See Bardwell v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 36 (2010) (where the Board makes a finding that lay evidence regarding an in-service event or injury is not credible, a VA examination is not required).  Any opinion purporting to relate currently diagnosed disorders to service would have to base such opinion on a factually inaccurate assumption of in-service injury, disease, or event; such factually inaccurate assumption would render the purported opinion of no probative value. Reonal v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 458, 461 (1993) (holding that a medical opinion based on an inaccurate factual basis is of no probative value). For these reasons, the Board finds that the duties to notify and assist have been met. \r\n\r\nService Connection Legal Criteria\r\n\r\nService connection may be granted for a disability arising from a disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a). Service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d). Service connection generally requires: (1) medical evidence of a current disability; (2) medical or, in certain circumstances, lay evidence of in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) medical evidence of a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the current disability. \r\n\r\nPTSD, depressive disorder, and anxiety disorder are not \"chronic diseases\" under 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a); therefore, the presumptive service connection provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b) for \"chronic\" in service symptoms and \"continuous\" post-service symptoms do not apply to the claim for service connection for these psychiatric disorders. Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013). \r\n\r\nService connection for PTSD requires the following three elements: (1) a current medical diagnosis of PTSD (presumed to include the adequacy of the PTSD symptomatology and the sufficiency of a claimed in-service stressor in accordance with 38 C.F.R. § 4.125(a)); (2) credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor occurred; and (3) medical evidence of a causal relationship between the current symptomatology and the specific claimed in-service stressor. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f). In adjudicating a claim for service connection for PTSD, the Board is required to evaluate evidence based on places, types, and circumstances of service, as shown by military records and all pertinent medical and lay evidence. See Hayes v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 60, 66 (1993); see also 38 U.S.C. § 1154(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f). The evidence necessary to establish the occurrence of an in-service stressor for PTSD will vary depending on if the veteran \"engaged in combat with the enemy.\" Id. \r\n\r\nIf a veteran did not engage in combat with the enemy, or the claimed stressors are not related to combat, and the stressor is not related to fear of hostile military or terrorist activity, then the veteran’s testimony alone is not sufficient to establish the occurrence of the claimed stressors, and his testimony must be corroborated by credible supporting evidence. Cohen v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 128 (1997); Moreau v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 389 (1996); Dizoglio v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 163 (1996). Furthermore, service department records must support, and not contradict, the claimant’s testimony regarding non-combat stressors. Doran v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 283 (1994).\r\n\r\nUnder 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f)(5), if a PTSD claim is based on in-service personal assault, evidence from sources other than the veteran's service records may corroborate the veteran's account of the stressor incident. Examples of such evidence include, but are not limited to: records from law enforcement authorities, rape crisis centers, mental health counseling centers, hospitals, or physicians; pregnancy tests or tests for sexually transmitted diseases; and statements from family members, roommates, fellow service members, or clergy. Evidence of behavior changes following the claimed assault is one type of relevant evidence that may be found in these sources. Examples of behavior changes that may constitute credible evidence of the stressor include, but are not limited to: a request for a transfer to another military duty assignment; deterioration in work performance; substance abuse; episodes of depression, panic attacks, or anxiety without an identifiable cause; or unexplained economic or social behavior changes. \r\n\r\nThe question of whether a veteran was exposed to a stressor in service is a factual one, and VA adjudicators are not bound to accept uncorroborated accounts of stressors or medical opinions based upon such accounts. Wood v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 190 (1991), aff’d on reconsideration, 1 Vet. App. 406 (1991). Hence, whether a stressor was of sufficient gravity to cause or support a diagnosis of PTSD is a question of fact for medical professionals. Whether the evidence establishes the occurrence of stressors, however, is a question of fact for adjudicators.\r\n\r\n1.\tDenial of Service Connection for PTSD\r\n\r\n2.\tDenial of Service Connection for Anxiety and Depression\r\n\r\nThe Veteran contends that an in-service stressor—the accidental killing of a Korean child and the South Korean soldiers’ subsequent assault and detention of the Veteran—caused his current PTSD. See Veteran’s October 2015 Written Statement; April 2019 Hearing Transcript of Veteran’s Testimony. Both the depressive disorder (also referred to as a not otherwise specified (NOS) disorder) and the anxiety disorder include PTSD-like symptoms and other psychiatric symptoms experienced by the Veteran during the current claim period (and before). See Mental Health Treatment Records; Three Lay Statements, submitted March 2016. This shows current disability of depressive disorder and anxiety disorder that also account for the symptoms claimed as PTSD symptoms. \r\n\r\nWith regard to the claimed in-service stressor, the Veteran reported that, while serving in Korea as a heavy vehicle operator, a fellow American soldier in a truck in front of him in an Army convoy accidentally ran over a Korean child who apparently had been standing in the snow near their route and slipped in front of the truck. The Veteran did not see the accident happen and later realized he had driven his own vehicle over the child’s body. The Veteran stated that South Korean soldiers pulled him out of the vehicle, assaulted him, and detained him. The Veteran further stated that his commanding officer and platoon sergeant took him and the other involved soldiers back to the scene of the incident, where the Veteran saw blood in the snow and the child’s body in one of the wheel wells. \r\n\r\nThe Veteran also asserted a second incident in which he saw a friend killed by South Korean insurgents; however, the Veteran did not provide the details necessary for VA to try to verify this stressor, and did not continue to pursue this assertion.\r\n\r\nAfter a review of the record, the Board finds that service connection for PTSD is not warranted because the claimed in-service stressor has not been sufficiently verified or corroborated by evidence of record, as required under 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f)(5). While the medical evidence includes a diagnosis of PTSD (see Mental Health Treatment Records), the post-service statements in the record from treating mental health professionals regarding the Veteran’s PTSD, which simply record the history as told to them by the Veteran, are not sufficient to corroborate the stressor. The recorded histories relied only on the Veteran’s non-credible reporting of the claimed in-service event asserted to be a stressor, and claimed subsequent psychological symptoms, and there has been no independent verification of the claimed stressor event of record.   \r\n\r\nAttempting to verify the stressor, VA conducted a Joint Service Records Research Center search, which was negative for any military records regarding the accidental killing of a South Korean child by an American soldier, as described by the Veteran. An accidental death of a Korean child and the subsequent physical detention by South Korean soldiers, a foreign military force of a sovereign country, is the sort of international and military incident that would have been documented and investigated by the command at the time of the incident. Specifically, VA researched available Army and other historical records and coordinated research with the National Archives and Records Administration, located in College Park, Maryland. Searches did not locate any unit records pertaining to the 7th Service and Transportation Battalion for the calendar year 1970. \r\n\r\nThe service personnel records and service treatment records (STRs) do not include any reports or even oblique references to an incident like accident involving a civilian child being run over by a convoy of trucks as described by the Veteran. The STRs and post-service evidence also contradicts and outweighs the Veteran’s recent assertion for compensation purposes that he experienced psychological symptoms beginning during service after the claimed in-service event. \r\n\r\nThe STRs, including the June 1970 service separation medical examination, note no psychiatric symptoms in service, including at service separation. In a June 1970 service medical history report, the Veteran specifically denied frequent or terrible nightmares, frequent trouble sleeping, symptoms of depression or excessive worry, and nervous trouble of any sort. This is contemporary, highly probative evidence as to the symptoms as to the Veteran did not experience in service because the reports are lay histories directly from the Veteran, are contemporaneous to service and close in time to the recently alleged in-service events and symptoms, and are consistent with other findings in the record such as absence of complaints, negative psychiatric findings when the Veteran was examined for service separation in 1970 and in 1978, and absence of complaints or treatment for years after service until submitting a claim for VA compensation in 2012. \r\n\r\nAt an enlistment examination in 1978, the Veteran provided a medical history specifically denying that he then had or had ever had symptoms of depression or excessive worry or nervous trouble of any sort. This is highly probative evidence of the non-existence of symptoms of anxiety or depression in the years after service until 1978 as it is again the Veteran’s own reported lay history specifically denying symptoms at any time in the past and at the present time in 1978, the statement was rendered closer in time to service than the current assertions and stories decades after service, and the statement was made for non-compensation purposes. The 1978 medical history the Veteran provided, specifically denying symptoms that he was being asked to report if he had them, is also probative because it is consistent with other lay and medical evidence such as the Veteran’s own denial of the same symptoms at the 1970 service medical history made at service separation, and clinical findings of no psychiatric abnormalities at service separation in 1970. \r\n\r\nThe Veteran filed a claim for service connection for other disorders in 1994 without claiming or mentioning a psychiatric disorder. On the current VA claim form for PTSD in February 2012, the Veteran failed to report that he had previously filed a VA claim, and omitted the solicited information as to when his PTSD symptoms began. This is further evidence that the Veteran did not in fact experience psychological symptoms since service, as he now alleges, and that recent assertions of in-service and continuous post-service psychological symptoms after service, including in testimony and by lay statements provided in an attempt to support the contradicted history, are outweighed by other evidence, so are not credible.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Veteran recently stated that he was hospitalized for anxiety (a nervous breakdown) while in service, the STRs do not include a record of this, do not show any psychiatric symptoms, and show the Veteran specifically and affirmatively denying symptoms similar to anxiety or depression. The Veteran indicates he is not able to provide necessary information to VA to allow for search for additional records. The June 1970 separation medical examination, based on a combination of the Veteran’s own reported medical history for the period of service and clinical observation, noted no psychiatric problems. In this context of multiple contradicted statements regarding stressors and symptoms, there is no suggestion that the belated reporting of hospitalization during service, ostensibly for anxiety, is credible; such a finding would be inconsistent with lay and medical evidence and findings both during and since service.   \r\n\r\nIn support of the current compensation claim, the Veteran submitted three lay statements in March 2016. None of these statements corroborates the occurrence of the claimed in-service stressor, and, additionally, are not credible on insinuations of symptoms soon after service. The first lay statement is from an individual who reports knowing the Veteran before and after service, even though not reporting how the Veteran allegedly was prior to service. This lay statement profers that the Veteran had changed after returning home from the Army. Those changes were described as looking empty inside, staring blankly, and waking up yelling, sweating, and speaking in Korean. This lay statement also indicated that after service the Veteran became an alcoholic, suffered from depression, and was suicidal. Although this lay statement asserts a change in the Veteran after service, the statement does not describe what the Veteran was like prior to service, is vague as to when the problems began, indicates non-service-related alcohol problems after service for which service connection is not available, and relies on distant memory as it was written over 45 years after the Veteran’s discharge from service. To the extent the statement suggests relevant symptoms began close in time to service, the statement suffers from all the flaws of the Veteran’s own recent and non-credible assertions of psychological symptoms beginning in service. This lay statement is not credible as it is inconsistent with other, more contemporaneous evidence of record, including the Veteran’s own medical history and findings at service separation in 1970 and again after service in 1978 specifically denying relevant psychological problems, and the absence of complaints or treatment for many years after service. As such, the Board finds this statement to have little probative value regarding corroboration of the in-service stressor or assertion of psychological symptoms soon after service. \r\n\r\nThe second statement is from a close friend who reports having known the Veteran over 29 years (since after service) and who has a Bachelor’s degree in Mental Health. Over the years, she has observed the Veteran suffer from bouts of depression, anxiety, and continuous sleeping problems. While this statement indicates psychological symptoms that began after service, it does not tend to corroborate the claimed in-service stressor in South Korea, and, when read in the context of all the other lay and medical evidence that includes specific denials of any psychiatric symptoms by the Veteran in 1970 and 1978, does not show symptoms beginning in service and continuing since service. \r\n\r\nFinally, the third statement is from another reported close friend, who has known the Veteran for over 20 years, which dates observation of the Veteran beginning decades after service. This statement reports marital trouble and employment during the last 20 years, that the Veteran has spoken about sleep problems including nightmares he experienced in Korea (without elaboration or detail), and the Veteran had bouts of depression, social isolation, jumpiness, shaky hands, and periods of time of blanking out. As this lay statement indicates observation of the Veteran for only the last 20 years, it does not corroborate the claimed in-service stressor, does not tend to show any psychological symptoms for many years after service, but only identifies more recent symptoms that would only tend to support findings of current disability – an element of the claim that has been substantiated, so is no longer at issue.       \r\n\r\nAs the weight of the evidence shows the reported event alleged to be the stressor is not corroborated, and the Veteran’s reports of the alleged in-service event are not credible, the Board finds there was no in-service injury, disease, or event. For these reasons, service connection for PTSD must be denied. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.304, 4.125.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the finding that the alleged in-service stressor event did not happen, the weight of the lay and medical evidence demonstrates that the Veteran’s depressive disorder and anxiety disorder did not begin in service and are not causally or etiologically related to service. The weight of the competent evidence shows no in-service psychological symptoms and no psychological symptoms for years after service. As there is no credible in-service event to which current diagnoses can be related, there is no further duty to assist by requesting a nexus opinion. For these reasons, the preponderance of the evidence is also against service connection for depressive disorder and anxiety disorder, and the claim must be denied. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.               \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nJ.
