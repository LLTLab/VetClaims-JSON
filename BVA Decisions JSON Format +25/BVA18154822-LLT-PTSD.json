The Veteran experienced a corroborated stressor event in service.\r\n2. The Veteran has a diagnosis of PTSD made in accordance with 38 C.F.R. § 4.125 (a) based on his corroborated in-service stressor.\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\nThe criteria for service connection for PTSD are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1131, 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.304.\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION\r\nThe Veteran had active service from June 1986 to January 1996.\r\nThis matter comes before the Board of Veterans’ Appeals (Board) on appeal from an August 2008 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Waco, Texas.\r\nIn August 2017, the Board denied the claim.  The Veteran appealed that decision to the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (“Court” or “CAVC”).  Pursuant to a Joint Motion for Remand (JMR), the Court vacated the Board decision and remanded it for action in accordance with the JMR. The claim on appeal has been recharacterized as one for an acquired psychiatric disorder.  Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1 (2009).\r\n1. Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)\r\nThe Veteran seeks service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder. For the reasons that follow, the Board finds that service connection for PTSD is warranted.\r\nGenerally, to establish service connection, a claimant must show: (1) a present disability; (2) an in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service, the so-called “nexus” requirement.  See 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131 (2012); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303; see also Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).\r\nIn addition to the general principles governing service connection, to establish entitlement to service connection for PTSD the evidence must satisfy three basic elements.  There must be: 1) medical evidence diagnosing PTSD; 2) a link, established by medical evidence, between current symptoms of PTSD and an in-service stressor; and 3) credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor occurred. 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f).  A diagnosis of PTSD must be established in accordance with 38 C.F.R. § 4.125(a).\r\nIn order to grant service connection for PTSD to a non-combat veteran, there must be credible evidence to support the Veteran’s assertion that the stressful event occurred. A stressor need not be corroborated in every detail.  Suozzi v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 307, 311 (1997).  Moreover, a medical opinion diagnosing PTSD does not suffice to verify the occurrence of the claimed in-service stressors.  Cohen v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 128, 142 (1997).\r\nThe claim file reflects current diagnoses of PTSD, depressive disorder not otherwise specified (NOS), and adjustment disorder with depressed mood.   The Veteran contends that his psychiatric disorder, specifically PTSD, is related to being on the flight deck of the USS Eisenhower when it collided with the Spanish bulk carrier Urduliz.  \r\nThe Board finds that the stressor event is corroborated.  The April 2008 PTSD Stressor/ AO worksheet, indicated that the Veteran’s in-service stressor event of being on the flight deck of the USS Eisenhower when it collided with the Spanish bulk carrier Urduliz, was conceded. The February 1990 National Transportation Safety Board Executive Summary confirmed the accident investigation.  The history reveals that the USS Eisenhower, a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, was entering the harbor at Hampton Roads, Virginia.  On August 29, 1988 at 08:20 hours, the USS Eisenhower struck the anchored Spanish bulk carrier, Urduliz, which was anchored adjacent to the Entrance Reach Channel, waiting for a berth at the coal loading piers at Lamberts Point, Norfolk, Virginia.  No one was injured.  The Veteran’s service personnel records  show he was aboard this ship at the time of the accident.\r\nRecords show that in November 2007 the Veteran presented for a psychology consultation precipitated by his involvement in a motor vehicle accident.   The clinician diagnosed the Veteran with PTSD.\r\nIn June 2008, the Veteran underwent a VA examination.  The Veteran reported that he had experienced nightmares about the in-service shipwreck since a car accident in May 2007.  The examiner diagnosed the Veteran with adjustment disorder with depressed mood and anxiety (secondary to the family strife and other recent stressors) and PTSD.  The examiner opined that the Veteran’s PTSD was more likely related to significant childhood trauma which the Veteran had repressed, as well as tense and stressful experiences while working as a security contractor in Iraq, and that it was less likely than not related to his in-service stressor being onboard the USS Eisenhower during the shipwreck.\r\nIn his May 2009 notice of disagreement, the Veteran reported that he had triggers that created flashbacks of the ship and he did not recall having nightmares as a child.  The Veteran noted that heavy trains that traveled behind his property, the smell of sodium chloride at work, and the smell of salt in pasta water triggered flashbacks of the ship.\r\nAt an October 2014 mental health clinic visit, the Veteran reported having flashbacks of being on the side of the ship when it ran into an anchored tanker in the bay.  The Veteran reported that he keeps dreaming and hearing phrases like “all hands brace of shock”, alarms ringing, and having to investigate the blue smoke damage and report to damage control.  The clinician noted that the Veteran’s PC-PTSD screen was positive, and that his PCL-M military version PTSD screen was positive with a raw score of 83.\r\nIn October 2018, a private psychologist conducted a telephonic interview and reviewed the VA claim file.  The examiner found that the Veteran met the criteria for PTSD according to both the DSM-IV and the DSM-5, and opined that the it is at least as likely as not that the Veteran’s PTSD is due to his corroborated in-service stressor.  The psychologist provided a rationale for her assessment, in part explaining that there was no convincing evidence of a pre-existing psychiatric disability.  The examiner noted that the Veteran received no treatment as a child, spoke fondly of his childhood, denied exposure to adverse childhood experiences, and that his service entrance exam failed to note any issue.  \r\nBased on a review of the evidence of record, the Board concludes that the Veteran has a current diagnosis of PTSD related to a corroborated in-service stressor.  The unfavorable opinion provided by the June 2008 VA examiner is competent and persuasive.  The opinion was based upon a comprehensive examination of the Veteran and a comprehensive review of his service and clinical history.  The Board also finds that the favorable findings of the October 2018 private psychologist are competent and probative. The clinician reviewed the Veteran’s claim file, conducted an interview, and provided a supporting rationale as to why the Veteran’s PTSD is related to his in-service stressor.\r\nIn short, the evidence is in at least equipoise on the question of whether the Veteran has PTSD as a result of an in-service stressor. Therefore, the Board must resolve reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran. 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.  Service connection for PTSD is warranted. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102. \r\n \r\nD.
