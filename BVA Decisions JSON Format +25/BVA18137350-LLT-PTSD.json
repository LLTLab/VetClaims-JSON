The record evidence shows that the Veteran does not experience any current right Achilles tendon disability which is attributable to active service.\r\n2.  The record evidence shows that Veteran’s alleged in-service stressor is not related to the fear of hostile military or terrorist activity and otherwise is incapable of corroboration.\r\n3.  The record evidence shows that there is no valid diagnosis of PTSD based on a corroborated in-service stressor.\r\nCONCLUSIONS OF LAW\r\n1.  The criteria for entitlement to a right Achilles tendon disability have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5103, 5103A, 5107 (West 2012); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.304 (2017).\r\n2.  The criteria for entitlement to service connection for PTSD have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5103, 5103A, 5107 (West 2012); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.304 (2017).\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS\r\nThe Veteran had active service in the U.S. Navy from November 1966 to August 1970 and from July 1971 to June 1973.  He also had additional U.S. Navy Reserve (USNR) service.\r\nIn September 2014, in response to a request from the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ), the National Personnel Records Center in St. Louis, Missouri (NPRC), informed VA that the Veteran’s complete service treatment records were not available for review.  Limited service treatment records for the Veteran were obtained electronically from the Defense Personnel Records and Information System (DPRIS) later in September 2014.  In cases where the Veteran's service treatment records are unavailable through no fault of the claimant, there is a heightened obligation to assist the claimant in the development of his or her case.  O'Hare v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 365 (1991).  VA also must provide an explanation to the appellant regarding VA's inability to obtain his or her service treatment records.  Dixon v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 261 (1992).  The Court has held that VA's efforts to obtain service department records shall continue until the records are obtained or unless it is reasonably certain that such records do not exist or that further efforts to obtain those records would be futile.  Hayre v. West, 188 F.3d 1327 (Fed. Cir. 1999); see also McCormick v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 39 (2000).  The AOJ contacted the Veteran in August and October 2014 and requested that he send VA any copies of his service treatment records which were in his possession.  There is no record of a response from the Veteran.  Having reviewed the record evidence, the Board finds that it is reasonably certain that the Veteran’s complete service treatment records do not exist and further efforts to attempt to obtain them would be futile.\r\nWhen he perfected a timely substantive appeal in May 2016, the Veteran asserted that he had never been seen by a VA clinician, his service treatment records had not been reviewed, his private medical records had not been requested, and his service treatment records had not been located.  These assertions of VA’s alleged errors in adjudicating his appeal are contrary to the facts of this appeal.  First, as is explained below in greater detail, the Veteran has not been examined for VA adjudication purposes because there is no competent evidence of either a right Achilles tendon disability or PTSD which could be attributed to active service.  In other words, VA’s duty to assist the Veteran by scheduling him for appropriate examinations is not triggered in this appeal.  Second, as noted above, the Veteran’s available service treatment records were obtained from DPRIS and reviewed by the AOJ and the Board.  The Board notes in this regard that the Veteran’s extensive service treatment records from his USNR service were obtained and associated with his claims file.  Third, the record evidence reflects that, after he provided a completed VA Form 21-4142 in June 2014 for his private physician, the AOJ contacted this physician and requested the Veteran’s complete treatment records.  These records subsequently were associated with the Veteran’s claims file.  Finally, although it is unfortunate that the Veteran’s complete service treatment records could not be obtained in this appeal, the lack of these complete records, alone, is not fatal to either of his currently appealed claims.  In summary, the Board finds that the Veteran’s May 2016 argument is without merit.\r\nService Connection\r\nThe Veteran contends that he incurred a right Achilles tendon disability and PTSD during active service.  He specifically contends that learning about the deaths of several fellow service members who were killed while refilling aviation tires with air during active service caused or contributed to his claimed PTSD.  The Veteran has not raised any other issues nor have any other issues been reasonably raised by the record.  See Doucette v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 366, 369-370 (2017) (confirming that Board not required to address issues unless specifically raised by claimant or reasonably raised by record evidence).\r\n1. Entitlement to a right Achilles tendon disability\r\nThe Board finds that the preponderance of the evidence is against granting the Veteran’s claim of service connection for a right Achilles tendon disability.  Despite the Veteran’s assertions to the contrary, the record evidence shows that he does not experience any current right Achilles tendon disability which is related to active service or any incident of service.  The Board again notes that the Veteran’s complete service treatment records from his 2 periods of active service are not available for review.  Although it is unfortunate that the Veteran’s complete service treatment records are not available, a review of certain service treatment records received from DPRIS in September 2014 shows that, at his second enlistment physical examination in July 1971, he denied any relevant pre-service medical history.  These records also show that his lower extremities were normal on clinical evaluation at his second separation physical examination in June 1973.  Similarly, the Veteran’s extensive service treatment records from his USNR service show no complaints of or treatment for a right Achilles tendon disability at any time during his approximately 16 years of USNR service.  He denied any relevant medical history and clinical evaluation repeatedly was normal during his USNR service.  The Board notes that the absence of contemporaneous records does not preclude granting service connection for a claimed disability.  See Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1337 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (finding lack of contemporaneous medical records does not serve as an \"absolute bar\" to the service connection claim); Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303 (2007) (\"Board may not reject as not credible any uncorroborated statements merely because the contemporaneous medical evidence is silent as to complaints or treatment for the relevant condition or symptoms\").\r\nThe post-service evidence also does not support granting the Veteran’s claim of service connection for a right Achilles tendon disability.  Contrary to the Veteran’s lay assertions, it shows that he does not experience any current disability due to his claimed right Achilles tendon disability which is attributable to active service or any incident of service.  For example, x-rays of the Veteran’s feet taken in June 2009 showed small bilateral Achilles calcaneal spurs but otherwise normal bony and soft tissue structures.  \r\nA service connection claim must be accompanied by evidence which establishes that the claimant currently has a disability.  Rabideau v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 141, 144 (1992); Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992).  Service connection is not warranted in the absence of proof of current disability.  The Board has considered whether the Veteran experienced a right Achilles tendon disability at any time during the pendency of this appeal. Service connection may be granted if there is a disability at some point during the claim even if it later resolves or becomes asymptomatic.  McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319 (2007).  Although the Veteran’s post-service treatment records show the presence of a small Achilles calcaneal spur, they do not show any current right Achilles tendon disability which is attributable to active service.  Critically, the Veteran does not contend – and the record evidence does not show – that he experiences right Achilles tendon pain, including as due to a right heel spur noted on 2009 x rays, resulting in functional impairment which is related to active service.  See Saunders v. Wilkie, No. 17-1466 (Fed. Cir. April 3, 2018) (holding that pain resulting in functional impairment constitutes a current disability).  The Veteran finally has not identified or submitted any evidence demonstrating his entitlement to service connection for a right Achilles tendon disability.  In summary, the Board finds that the criteria for service connection for a right Achilles tendon disability have not been met.\r\n2. Entitlement to service connection for PTSD\r\nThe Board finally finds that the preponderance of the evidence is against granting the Veteran’s claim of service connection for PTSD.  The Veteran contends that he incurred PTSD during active service after learning about the in-service deaths of several fellow service members who were killed while refilling aviation tires with air.  The record evidence does not support the Veteran’s assertions regarding a valid diagnosis of PTSD based on a corroborated in-service stressor.  Although it is unfortunate that the Veteran’s complete service treatment records are not available for review (as discussed above), his available service treatment records show no complaints of or treatment for PTSD during either period of active service or during his approximately 16 years of USNR service.  The Board again notes that the absence of contemporaneous records does not preclude granting service connection for a claimed disability.  See Buchanan, 451 F.3d at 1337, and Barr, 21 Vet. App. at 303.\r\nThe post-service evidence also does not support granting the Veteran’s service connection claim for PTSD.  The Board acknowledges that the Veteran had a positive PTSD screen on VA outpatient treatment in August 2014.\r\nIn an August 2014 letter, the Veteran’s private treating psychologist, J.L.J., Ph.D., stated that he had been treating the Veteran for a year for PTSD symptoms related to his active service.  The Veteran reported experiencing flashbacks, intrusive thoughts, guilt, and nightmares related to in-service events.  The Veteran also reported avoiding “public places where groups of people might congregate.  He avoids talking about the events with others, and makes attempts to avoid thinking about the events that occurred during his time of service.”  Dr. J.L.J. stated that the Veteran had not made any “significant improvements” in the previous year despite attending “multiple sessions of individual and group counseling on a weekly to bi-weekly basis.”  Dr. J.L.J. also stated that the Veteran’s PTSD “has worsened due [to] continued rumination about events that occurred in Vietnam since retiring.”  The Veteran also experienced depression, problems with attention, focus, and concentration, periods of sadness, crying, disturbed sleep, “difficulties getting along with others,” and suicidal ideation once or twice a month.  Dr. J.L.J. concluded that the Veteran “is incapable of appropriate social and occupational functioning.” (Emphasis in original.)\r\nIn another letter also dated in August 2014 but not received by the AOJ until September 2014, Dr. J.L.J. stated that the Veteran identified his alleged in-service stressor as “learning about the deaths of three airmen who were killed when refilling tires with air.  There were two different incidents on two separate boats.  [The Veteran] was stationed on both boats where these events occurred and was nearby when they happened.”  (The Board notes parenthetically that the remainder of the September 2014 letter from Dr. J.L.J. is identical to what he submitted in August 2014 so it will not be repeated here.)\r\nThe Court has held that the Board is free to assess medical evidence and is not compelled to accept a physician's opinion.  Wilson v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 614 (1992).  A medical opinion based upon an inaccurate factual premise is not probative.  Reonal v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 458, 461 (1993).  A bare conclusion, even one reached by a medical professional, is not probative without a factual predicate in the record.  Miller v. West, 11 Vet. App. 345, 348 (1998).  A bare transcription of lay history, unenhanced by additional comment by the transcriber, does not become competent medical evidence merely because the transcriber is a medical professional.  LeShore v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 406, 409 (1995).  The Court also has held that the value of a physician's statement is dependent, in part, upon the extent to which it reflects \"clinical data or other rationale to support his opinion.\" Bloom v. West, 12 Vet. App. 185, 187 (1999).  Thus, a medical opinion is inadequate when it is unsupported by clinical evidence.  Black v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 177, 180 (1995).  \r\nHaving reviewed the August and September 2014 letters from Dr. J.L.J., the Board finds that this evidence is not probative on the issue of whether the Veteran has a valid diagnosis of PTSD based on a corroborated in-service stressor.  First, this evidence is based entirely on what the Veteran (inaccurately) reported to Dr. J.L.J. regarding his in-service history.  Contrary to what he reported to Dr. J.L.J., and although his service personnel records confirm that he served as an aircraft mechanic in the U.S. Navy, the Veteran’s available service personnel records show that he never served in Vietnam.  Thus, any statements made by the Veteran to Dr. J.L.J. in 2014 about “continued rumination about events that occurred in Vietnam” simply are not credible because they are not consistent with the facts and circumstances of his active service.  Dr. J.L.J. also did not identify any clinical evidence on which his 2014 letters describing the Veteran’s alleged PTSD are based.  Accordingly, given the inadequacies of the letters dated in 2014 from Dr. J.L.J., the Board finds that this evidence has no probative value on the issue of whether the Veteran currently experiences PTSD based on a corroborated in-service stressor.\r\nThe Board notes here that, in general, service connection for PTSD requires medical evidence diagnosing the condition in accordance with VA regulations; a link, established by medical evidence, between current symptoms and an in-service stressor; and credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor occurred.  The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit) has held that “PTSD is not the type of medical condition that lay evidence…is competent and sufficient to identify.”  See Young v. McDonald, 766 F.3d 1348, 1353 (Fed. Cir. 2014).  In July 2010, VA published a final rule that amended its adjudication regulations governing service connection for PTSD by relaxing, in certain circumstances, the evidentiary standard for establishing the required in-service stressor.  See 75 Fed. Reg. 39843 (July 13, 2010) as amended by 75 Fed. Reg. 41092 (July 15, 2010) (providing the correct effective date of July 13, 2010 for the revised 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f)).  \r\nSpecifically, the final rule amends 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f) by redesignating current paragraphs (f)(3) and (f)(4) as paragraphs (f)(4) and (f)(5), respectively, and by adding a new paragraph (f)(3) that reads as follows: \r\n(f)(3) If a stressor claimed by a Veteran is related to the Veteran’s fear of hostile military or terrorist activity and a VA psychiatrist or psychologist, or a psychiatrist or psychologist with whom VA has contracted, confirms that the claimed stressor is adequate to support a diagnosis of [PTSD] and that the Veteran’s symptoms are related to the claimed stressor, in the absence of clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, and provided the claimed stressor is consistent with the places, types, and circumstances of the Veteran’s service, the Veteran’s lay testimony alone may establish the occurrence of the claimed in-service stressor.  For purposes of this paragraph, “fear of hostile military or terrorist activity” means that a Veteran experienced, witnessed, or was confronted with an event or circumstance that involved actual or threatened death or serious injury, or a threat to the physical integrity of the Veteran or others, such as from an actual or potential improvised explosive device; vehicle-imbedded explosive device; incoming artillery, rocket, or mortar fire; grenade; small arms fire, including suspected sniper fire; or attack upon friendly military aircraft, and the Veteran’s response to the event or circumstance involved a psychological or psycho-physiological state of fear, helplessness, or horror.\r\nId.  The revised § 3.304(f) generally applies to claims of service connection for PTSD appealed to the Board on or after July 13, 2010, including the Veteran’s currently appealed service connection claim for PTSD.\r\nAlthough the Veteran’s claim was filed after the revised § 3.304(f) became effective, the Board observes that the Federal Circuit has limited the applicability of the revised § 3.304(f) to appeals where “a claimed in-service PTSD stressor relates to an event or circumstance that a Veteran experienced, witnessed, or was confronted with and that was perpetrated by a member of an enemy military or by a terrorist.”  See Hall v. Shinseki, 717 F.3d 1369, 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2013) (emphasis added); see also Acevedo v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 286, 291 (2012) (“[T]he examples provided [in subsection (f)(3)] all involve actions originating from individuals who commit hostile military or terrorist acts toward the U.S. military, not nefarious, or even criminal, acts of one service member directed at another service member.”) (emphasis added).  The Veteran’s claimed in-service stressor in this appeal – learning about the deaths of several fellow service members who were killed while refilling aviation tires with air – was not “perpetrated by a member of any enemy military or by a terrorist.”  Id.  Accordingly, the Board finds that the revised § 3.304(f) is not applicable to the Veteran’s service connection claim for PTSD.\r\nThe Board next notes that the AOJ previously concluded in a memorandum to the file dated in October 2014 that the Veteran’s alleged in-service stressor either was incapable of corroboration by the Joint Services Records Research Center (JSRRC) or there was insufficient information provided by the Veteran concerning this alleged in-service incident to send it to the JSRRC for corroboration.  Because the former 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f) is applicable to this claim, and because the Veteran’s alleged in-service stressor is incapable of corroboration by the JSRRC, the Board agrees with the AOJ’s October 2014 findings concerning this alleged in-service incident that there is no corroborated in-service stressor of record on which a valid diagnosis of PTSD must be based in order to grant service connection for this disability.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f) (effective prior to July 13, 2010).\r\nThe Veteran contends that he incurred PTSD while on active service.  Although Dr. J.L.J. diagnosed the Veteran as having and treated him for PTSD in 2014, this diagnosis was not based on an in-service stressor which is capable of corroboration by the JSRRC.  And, as discussed above, the 2014 letters from Dr. J.L.J. have no probative value on the issue of whether the Veteran currently experiences disability due to his claimed PTSD based on a corroborated in-service stressor.  Accordingly, there is no valid diagnosis of PTSD due to a corroborated in-service stressor as is required for a grant of service connection for this disability under the former diagnostic criteria. Id.  The Veteran finally has not identified or submitted any evidence demonstrating his entitlement to service connection for PTSD.  In summary, the Board finds that service connection for PTSD is not warranted.\r\n \r\nR. FEINBERG\r\nVeterans Law Judge\r\nBoard of Veterans’ Appeals\r\nATTORNEY FOR THE BOARD\tMichael T.
