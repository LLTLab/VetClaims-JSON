The Veteran died in February 2016. The Appellant is the Veteran’s surviving spouse.  A February 2016 letter from VA to the Appellant documents that she has been substituted for the Veteran in this case.  \r\n\r\nThis matter comes before the Board of Veterans’ Appeals (Board) on appeal from a November 2013 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).\r\n\r\nIn March 2016, the Appellant testified at a hearing before the undersigned Veterans Law Judge (VLJ) and a transcript of the proceeding is of record.\r\n\r\nService Connection\r\n\r\nService connection may be granted for a disability resulting from a disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. See 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (a). “To establish a right to compensation for a present disability, a Veteran must show: “(1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service”- the so-called “nexus” requirement.” Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1362, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (quoting Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).\r\n\r\n1. Entitlement to post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)\r\n\r\nThe Appellant contends that the Veteran had PTSD due to his in-service involvement in Secret/Covert Operations.\r\n\r\nTo establish entitlement to service connection for PTSD, the record must contain the following: (1) medical evidence diagnosing PTSD; (2) credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor actually occurred; and (3) medical evidence of a link between current symptomatology and the claimed in-service stressor. 38 C.F.R. § 3.304 (f).\r\n\r\nIf a stressor claimed by a veteran is related to the veteran’s fear of hostile military or terrorist activity and a VA psychiatrist or psychologist, or a psychiatrist or psychologist with whom VA has contracted, confirms that the claimed stressor is adequate to support a diagnosis of PTSD, and the veteran’s symptoms are related to the claimed stressor, in the absence of clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, and provided the claimed stressor is consistent with the places and circumstances of the veteran’s service, the veteran’s lay testimony alone may establish the occurrence of the claimed in-service stressor. For purposes of this paragraph, “fear of hostile military or terrorist activity” means that a veteran experienced, witnessed, or was confronted with an event or circumstance that involved actual or threatened death or serious injury, or a threat to the physical integrity of the veteran or others, such as from an actual or potential improvised explosive device; vehicle-imbedded explosive device; incoming artillery, rocket, or mortar fire; grenade; small arms fire, including suspected sniper fire; or attack upon friendly military aircraft, and the veteran’s response to the event or circumstance involved a psychological or psycho-physiological state of fear, helplessness, or horror. 38 C.F.R. § 3.304 (f)(3).\r\n\r\nWith regard to the criteria for service connection for PTSD, the February 2013 VA examiner indicated a diagnosis of PTSD. As such, the first element is met.\r\n\r\nAs the record contains a diagnosis of PTSD, the question in this case is whether the Veteran has a verified stressor that could have resulted in the development of this disorder. Here, the Board finds that there is no independent evidence to corroborate the Veteran’s reported noncombat stressors. The record does not reveal that the Veteran served in combat. In addition, the claimed stressors did not involve the fear of hostile military or terrorist activity. Therefore, absent credible supporting evidence showing that the stressors occurred, service connection cannot be granted for PTSD.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran claimed that he experienced several stressors during service.  In a November 2013 Statement in Support of Claim (VA Form 21-4138, the Veteran reported being a covert operative aboard ships to catch sellers of drugs and thieves of military supplies, and that a can of paint was dumped on his face).  The Veteran also reported during a February 2013 office visit to a VA psychiatrist, Dr. Cannell, that he was a covert operative sniper who shot and killed people and witnessed torture. The Appellant testified at the March 2019 hearing that the Veteran told her he witnessed someone’s fingers being cut off during service, and another instance of a man overboard screaming for someone to help. \r\n\r\nThe Veteran did not submit any corroborating lay statements to support his contention that he participated in covert operations during service. The Board considered the statements submitted by the Veteran’s art student and his spouse, but these do not corroborate the Veteran’s reported stressors. The Veteran’s military personnel records reflect that he received the American Theater, WW2 Victory Medal, China Service Medal, Navy Occupation Ribbon, Mediterranean Medal, and Asiatic Pacific Ribbon, but these decorations, medals, or awards are not indicative of participation in combat. His military occupational specialty was a cook and there is no evidence in his records of direct combat with the enemy or was involved in covert or secret operations. Therefore, the evidence of record does not support a finding that the Veteran was a combat Veteran.\r\n\r\nVA has attempted to corroborate the Veteran’s reported stressors. In November 2013, Joint Services Records Research Center (JSRRC) made a formal finding that there was a lack of information required to corroborate stressors associated with a claim for service connection for PTSD.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran’s service treatment records do not indicate any symptoms of, or treatment for, PTSD or any psychiatric disorder while in-service. The Veteran reported no psychiatric symptoms on his exit examination. The claims file indicates that the Veteran’s first treatment for psychiatric symptoms was in 2011, approximately 59 years after service.\r\n\r\nThe Board notes that the February 2013 VA examiner stated that the Veteran’s PTSD is directly a result of the Veteran’s military trauma. However, the examiner based his opinion off the Veteran’s reported stressors. As noted above, these stressors are not independently verified and therefore the examiner’s nexus opinion is not probative as it is based upon unverified stressors.\r\n\r\nAs the in-service stressors have not been shown by credible supporting evidence to have occurred, service connection cannot be granted for PTSD. The appeal must therefore be denied; there is no reasonable doubt to be resolved as to this issue. 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nJAMES G. REINHART\r\n\r\nVeterans Law Judge\r\n\r\nBoard of Veterans’ Appeals\r\n\r\nAttorney for the Board\tKatie Poe, Associate Counsel\r\n\r\nThe Board’s decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential, and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303. \r\n\r\n"
