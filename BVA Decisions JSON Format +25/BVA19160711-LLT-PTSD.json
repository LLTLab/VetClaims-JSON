The more persuasive evidence establishes that the Veteran does not have PTSD that is in accordance with the American Psychiatric Association Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders (DSM) for any period on appeal. \r\n\r\n2. The Veteran’s other psychiatric disorders, to include unspecified depressive disorder, did not have onset during active service and are not otherwise related to active service.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nThe criteria for entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include posttraumatic stress disorder (PSTD) and unspecified depressive disorder, have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107 (West 2014); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.304, 3.306 (2018).\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran served in the U.S. Army from August 1966 to May 1969. \r\n\r\nThis matter comes before the Board of Veterans’ Appeals (Board) from a February 2013 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).  In July 2014, the Veteran had a hearing before the undersigned Veterans Law Judge at the RO in Phoenix.  In February 2018, the Board remanded this claim to provide the Veteran a new VA examination, which was done in March 2019. The Board finds there has been substantial compliance with its prior remand directives. Stegall v. West, Vet. App. 268, 270-71 (1998). \r\n\r\nNeither the Veteran nor his representative has raised any issues with the duty to notify or duty to assist, or with the conduct of his hearing before the undersigned. See Scott v. McDonald, 789 F.3d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (holding that “the Board’s obligation to read filings in a liberal manner does not require the Board... to search the record and address procedural arguments when the veteran fails to raise them before the Board”); Dickens v. McDonald, 814 F.3d 1359, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2016). Thus, the Board need not discuss any potential issues in this regard.\r\n\r\nThe Board must analyze the credibility and probative value of the evidence, account for the evidence which it finds to be persuasive or unpersuasive and provide the reasons for its rejection of any material favorable to the claimant, when rendering a decision on appeal. See Gabrielson v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 36, 39-40 (1994); Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 57 (1990). Competency of evidence differs from weight and credibility. Competency is a legal concept determining whether testimony may be heard and considered by the trier of fact, while credibility is a factual determination going to the probative value of the evidence to be made after the evidence has been admitted. See Rucker v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 67, 74 (1997); Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469 (1994).\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn determining whether service connection is warranted for a disability, VA is responsible for determining whether the evidence supports the claim or is in relative equipoise, with the veteran prevailing in either event, or whether a preponderance of the evidence is against the claim, in which case the claim is denied. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990).  When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination, the benefit of the doubt is afforded to the claimant. See Gilbert, 1 Vet. App. at 53.\r\n\r\nThe Board has thoroughly reviewed all the evidence in the Veteran’s VA files. In every decision, the Board must provide a statement of the reasons or bases for its determination, adequate to enable the Veteran to understand the precise basis for the Board’s decision, as well as to facilitate review by the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court). 38 U.S.C. § 7104 (d)(1) (2012); see Allday v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 517, 527 (1995). Although the entire record must be reviewed by the Board, the Court has repeatedly found that the Board is not required to discuss, in detail, every piece of evidence. See Gonzales v. West, 218 F.3d 1378, 1380-81 (Fed. Cir. 2000); Dela Cruz v. Principi, 15 Vet. App. 143, 149 (2001) (rejecting the notion that the Veterans Claims Assistance Act mandates that the Board discuss all evidence). Rather, the law requires only that the Board address its reasons for rejecting evidence favorable to the Veteran. See Timberlake v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 122 (2000). The analysis below focuses on the most salient and relevant evidence and on what this evidence shows, or fails to show, on the claim. The Veteran must not assume that the Board has overlooked pieces of evidence that are not explicitly discussed herein. See Timberlake, supra.\r\n\r\nService Connection\r\n\r\nService connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by service. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (a). Generally, service connection requires: (1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service.  See Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004); see also Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498 (1995). Service connection may also be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge when the evidence establishes that the disease was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (d).\r\n\r\nService connection for PTSD requires medical evidence diagnosing the condition in accordance with the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 4.125 (a); a link, established by medical evidence, between current symptoms and in-service stressors; and credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor or stressors occurred. 38 C.F.R. § 3.304 (f). \r\n\r\nAlternatively, if a stressor claimed by a Veteran is related to the Veteran’s fear of hostile military or terrorist activity and a VA psychiatrist or psychologist, or a psychiatrist or psychologist with whom VA has contracted, confirms that the claimed stressor is adequate to support a diagnosis of PTSD and that the Veteran’s symptoms are related to the claimed stressor, in the absence of clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, and provided the claimed stressor is consistent with the places, types, and circumstances of the Veteran’s service, the Veteran’s lay testimony alone may establish the occurrence of the claimed in-service stressor. 38 C.F.R. § 3.304 (f)(3).\r\n\r\nIn addition, certain chronic diseases may be service connected on a presumptive basis if manifested to a compensable degree in a specified period of time following service, including psychoses. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1112, 1113 (West 2014); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309 (2018). In this case, the Veteran’s diagnosed psychiatric disorders, to include PTSD and unspecified depressive disorder, are not psychoses. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.384 (defining “psychoses” for purposes of Part 3 of the VA regulations). As such, the claimed psychiatric disorders are not “chronic diseases” listed under 38 C.F.R. § 3.309 (a), and the presumptive service connection provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (b) do not apply. Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2014). \r\n\r\nThe Veteran contends he is entitled to service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder (PSTD), because he feared for his life while stationed in Vietnam, for his base was constantly under mortar attacks, close enough to take his life away. See July 2010 21-0781 form. The representative further argues that the Board should grant service connection under 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f)(3), given his diagnoses and the already conceded in-service stressor related to fear of hostile military activity. See June 2019 VA 646 form.   \r\n\r\nUnder Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1, 5 (2009), the Veteran’s claim cannot be “limited only to that diagnosis but must rather be considered a claim for any mental disability that may be reasonably encompassed.” Id. Therefore, applying the holding in Clemons to the present case, the claim on appeal has been recharacterized as a claim of entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD and unspecified depressive disorder.\r\n\r\nGiven the consistent and credible lay assertions and the relaxed stressor standard, the Veteran’s in-service stressor related to fear of hostile military has been conceded. However, the mere existence of an in-service event is not enough for a grant of service connection.  In this case, even conceding his in-service stressor and applying the amended regulation involving stressors related to a fear of hostile military or terrorist activity, the Board concludes that the claim must be denied, because (1) more probative evidence does not support a diagnosis of PTSD in accordance with either the DSM-IV or the DSM-5 criteria, and also because (2) his current (non-PTSD) psychiatric disorder was not incurred in service or is related to his service. \r\n\r\nAppeals initially certified to the Board prior to August 4, 2014 require the Veteran’s claim be examined under the DSM-IV criteria. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.125; 79 Fed. Reg. 45,093, 45,094-096 (Aug. 4, 2014) (interim final rule); 80 Fed. Reg. 14,308 (Mar. 19, 2015) (final rule) (providing that for claims that were initially certified for appeal to the Board, the Court, or the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit prior to August 4, 2014, DSM-IV will apply. For all applications for benefits received by VA or pending before the agency of original jurisdiction on or after August 4, 2014, DSM-5 will apply). In this case, while the Veteran’s appeal was certified in May 2014, he was afforded two VA examinations that applied the DSM-IV criteria, as well as a VA examination that applied the DSM-5 criteria. None of those examinations provided a diagnosis of PTSD that conforms to either the DSM-IV or the DSM-5 criteria. See December 2011 VA examination; July 2012 VA examination; May 2019 VA examination. \r\n\r\nFor instance, during the very first VA examination (December 2011 VA examination), the examiner concluded, after thoroughly reviewing all relevant records, that the Veteran had no diagnosis of PTSD or any other mental health disorder that conforms to the DSM-IV criteria. During the examination, despite finding both of his stressors (exposure to “body bags” while carrying out morgue duty for one week in-service; and exposure to mortar attacks in service and being frightened for his life) as adequate to support the diagnosis of PTSD and as related to his fear of hostile military or terrorist activity, not all PTSD diagnostic criteria were found to be met during that time. His reported symptoms (ie. wanting to be alone, anger, regrets, depression) were found to be in only the “subclinical range and sub-diagnostic.” See December 2011 VA examination. Similar observations were made during the July 2012 VA examination, in which a licensed psychologist opined, after thoroughly reviewing all pertinent records, that the Veteran did not have a diagnosis of PTSD nor of any other mental disorders that met the DSM-IV criteria, given the incongruencies between his report and the objective findings, as well as the invalid/extreme scales he scored on various objective psychological testing. \r\n\r\nAs noted earlier, the Veteran was also afforded a VA examination that applied the DSM-5 criteria, after the February 2018 Board remand (which was ordered to reconcile the conflicting medical findings as to his diagnosis of an acquired psychiatric disorder, such as the private medical treatment records that show positive diagnosis of PTSD and major depressive disorder, which will be further discussed below). During this VA examination (in March 2019), he was diagnosed solely with an unspecified depressive disorder under the DSM-5 criteria. While one of the two stressors (mortar attacks and the subsequent apprehension while deployed in Vietnam) was found to be adequate to support the diagnosis of PTSD and also related to his fear of hostile military activity, his symptoms were ultimately not found to meet the diagnostic criteria for PTSD under DSM-5 criteria. Instead, his symptoms (per the Veteran’s report, mild memories and hypervigilance related symptoms) were found to better represent those of an unspecified depressive disorder under the DSM-5 criteria. \r\n\r\nAfter reviewing all records, the Board finds that service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, is not warranted. In doing so, the Board gives high probative value to the VA examinations, as discussed further below. \r\n\r\nFirst, applying DSM-IV to this case, the Board finds the July 2012 VA examination especially persuasive probative value.  The opinions were provided pursuant to the required DSM-IV criteria in effect at that time, by a qualified clinical psychologist.  The examiner thoroughly reviewed all pertinent records and met personally with the Veteran. Notably, in reaching the medical conclusion, the July 2012 VA examiner highlighted the Veteran’s relatively extreme MMPI-2 scores (where the examiner noted that the Veteran’s endorsement of rare and extreme symptoms that are rarely endorsed even by psychiatric inpatients, and that because the scores on those numerous validity scales were so extreme, the clinical scales were rendered uninterpretable and invalid) and a much-higher-than-the-average MENT score (ie. he scored 6, while the average score is 2 and the cutoff score is 8; this is a test used to identify individuals from the normative sample who were deemed to be feigning PTSD), the incongruencies between the Veteran’s presentation and the symptoms reported, a drastic deterioration of the GAF score (from 70 to 50, or from relatively high functioning into the severe clinical range) within a few months (which, the examiner noted as being inconsistent with the clinical course of PTSD), as well as a seemingly significant embellishment/exaggeration of his own symptoms (ie. “[he] reported many symptoms of PTSD, but they were incongruous to his presentation”; “as a result of his retirement, the Veteran likely has more time to review his life and may be feeling distressed…it is likely that he is misattributing this current distress to his tour in Vietnam. He may be embellishing his symptoms to underscore his emotional distress”; “his scores were well past the cut-off on four validity scales, making interpretation of the clinical scales invalid. The score was consistent with exaggerating symptoms”). See July 2012 VA examination. \r\n\r\nSecond, as for the DSM-5 criteria, the 2019 examination is also especially persuasive evidence against the claim.  The examination was done by a qualified clinical psychologist, who thoroughly reviewed all records, to include the competing medical findings as to diagnosis of his acquired psychiatric condition (ie. private medical evidence and a VA treatment record that showed diagnosis for PTSD and major depressive disorder, which will be further addressed below).  Specifically, in concluding that the Veteran only has a major depressive disorder under the DSM-5 criteria, the March 2019 VA examiner underlined that the onset of symptoms reportedly occurred following his retirement in 2011, as consistently found in his medical treatment records, and that his reported symptoms did not meet the criteria for a full diagnosis of PTSD under DSM-5 (ie. symptoms associated with anxiety, panic, phobias, obsessions/compulsions, eating disorders, hypomania/mania, or those associated with a thought disorder). The examiner also pointed out that the Veteran presented a below-the-cutoff score for a symptom validity test (SVT), consistent with the finding noted during the previous VA examinations (ie. the Veteran exaggerating his psychiatric condition for compensation purposes). See March 2019 VA examination. \r\n\r\nThe Board is cognizant of the competing medical findings (ie. private treatment records and in a VA treatment record provided prior to the March 2019 VA examination), with regards to the Veteran’s diagnosis for his acquired psychiatric condition, and such competing medical opinions must be resolved. See Owens v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 429, 433 (1995). Mere disagreement among examiners does not indicate that the evidence is in equipoise. These diagnoses of PTSD are less probative than the VA examinations for the reasons discussed below.\r\n\r\nTo the extent that a diagnosis of PTSD is noted within the Veteran’s private treatment records and a VA treatment record (ie. July 2013 & April 2012 private treatment records; February 2019 VA treatment records), it is based exclusively on the Veteran’s self-reported history of PTSD treatment and symptoms and is not probative evidence in this determination. In other words, the private medical providers and a February 2019 VA psychiatrist did not thoroughly review all pertinent records in reaching the diagnosis of PTSD, but instead, relied heavily on the Veteran’s self-report, albeit inaccurate, in noting the diagnosis. The Board finds that the probative evidence of record does not document that the Veteran has been diagnosed with PTSD in accordance with the DSM for any period on appeal. Specifically, (1) the June 2013 (millennium physician group) private treatment records merely list his symptoms and note that he (the private medical provider) had explained to the Veteran that his condition is related to his experiences in the service, and that he had recommended that the Veteran see a psychiatrist for a full evaluation of PTSD, but without providing any explanations or rationales behind his findings, and there is also no indication that individual is a trained mental health professional (especially in light of the fact he stated the Veteran should see such a person); (2) the April 2012 (staff psychiatrist) psychiatric assessment that documents a diagnosis of PTSD and major depressive disorder, which was not based on any extensive psychiatric testing and also with no meaningful discussion for how the DSM criteria for such a diagnosis were met; and (3) the February 2019 VA treatment records show that the VA psychiatrist did not review the full criteria of DSM-5 PTSD, nor reviewed all pertinent records in providing a diagnosis of DSM-5 PTSD—unlike the aforementioned VA examiners. All VA examinations, throughout the appeals period, concluded he did not meet the criteria for diagnosing PTSD and commented that he did not report any symptoms indicative of PTSD under any of the DSM criteria. In other words, all the VA examiners listened to the Veteran’s account of his service experiences, and considered his symptoms, but concluded he does not have PTSD. In contrast to the detailed explanations of why the DSM criteria for diagnosing PTSD were not met, the providers that did show such a diagnosis gave no meaningful rationale as to how they reached that conclusion, nor did they discuss the conflicting medical evidence.  As such, service connection is not warranted for PTSD, as the Veteran does not have a persuasive diagnosis of PTSD.\r\n\r\nIn summary, even applying the amended standard for in-service stressor, the Board finds he is not entitled to service connection for PTSD for the more probative evidence show does not support a diagnosis of PTSD that conforms to either DSM-IV or DSM-5.  As the preponderance of the evidence is against the claim of entitlement to service connection for PTSD, the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine has no application. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b) (2012); Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 53 (1990).\r\n\r\nThe analysis for service connection claims involving acquired psychiatric disabilities, other than PTSD, follows the direct service connection criteria under 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. In this case, the evidence preponderates against the Veteran’s claim of entitlement to service connection for an unspecified depressive disorder. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nInitially, the Board notes that while the Veteran was provided multiple VA examinations for assessing his acquired psychiatric condition (to include both the DSM-IV and DSM-5 criteria), he was diagnosed with a non-PTSD acquired psychiatric condition (unspecified depressive disorder) only during the March 2019 VA examination, which used the DSM-5 criteria. In any case, the Board finds that he has a current psychiatric disability for he has a current diagnosis of an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include unspecified depressive disorder. See March 2019 VA examination. \r\n\r\nHis service treatment records do not reflect any history, complaints, treatment or diagnosis of an acquired psychiatric disorder during his active military service. In fact, during a May 1969 separation examination, he reported having had mumps, color blindness, and hay fever, but not any psychiatric related conditions. He was also found to have all clinically normal condition during that time. See May 1969 separation examination.  He has not alleged his symptoms began during service or have been continuous since.\r\n\r\nUpon review of all the evidence, lay and medical, the Board finds the weight of the evidence shows that an acquired psychiatric disability, other than PTSD, was not incurred during the Veteran’s period of active service, did not have onset during active service, and was not otherwise caused by his active military service. \r\n\r\nAlthough the Veteran began a Vietnam Veterans group and an anger management group around 2007 (see July 2012 VA examination), he testified that it was in fact around 2011, after retiring from the workforce, that he really began seeking treatment for his psychiatric condition.  The July 2012 VA examination further provided that he had been prescribed psychotropic medication since March 2012. See July 2014 Board hearing testimony; July 2012 VA examination. His treatment records and psychiatric assessments also consistently document the onset of his psychiatric condition (ie feeling depressed since his retirement) as 2011, the year that he retired. See March 2012 treatment records; see April 2012 treatment records; see June 2013 private treatment records, see July 2012 VA examination; see December 2011 VA examination. The fact that he reported onset of his psychiatric symptoms as to 2011 weighs heavily against his claim that his psychiatric condition began in service. \r\n\r\nThere is only one medical etiology opinion with regards to his non-PTSD, acquired psychiatric condition (unspecified depressive disorder), which was provided during the March 2019 VA examination. After thoroughly reviewing all evidence, to include private and VA treatment records, service treatment records, and the VA examinations, the March 2019 VA examiner diagnosed him solely with unspecified depressive disorder using the DSM-5, and further opined that it is less likely than not that his unspecified depressive disorder was incurred in or caused by service. In doing so, as noted earlier, the examiner explained that (1) his symptoms are primarily secondary to his retirement, as the onset of symptoms reportedly occurred following his retirement in 2011, resulting in his initial engagement in mental health care treatment, and (2) further pointed out, after extensively reviewing all records, that the evidence does not confirm, within a reasonable degree of clinical probability, a temporal relationship between his current reported symptoms and his military service. See March 2019 VA examination.  \r\n\r\nFurthermore, while there are other VA and private treatment records that show other diagnosis (ie. major depressive disorder) as to his non-PTSD psychiatric disorders, none of these documents provide any etiology opinions as to the diagnosed psychiatric conditions.   \r\n\r\nThe Veteran’s lay statements have been considered in this decision. However, as a layperson, the Veteran is without the appropriate medical training and expertise to offer an opinion on a medical matter, including the diagnosis or etiology of a specific mental health disability. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007); see also Young v. McDonald, 766 F.3d 1348, 1353 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (holding that “PTSD is not the type of medical condition that lay evidence... is competent and sufficient to identify”).\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAs the preponderance of the evidence is against the claim of entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability, other than PTSD, the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine has no application. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b) (2012); Gilbert, 1 Vet. App. at 53. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nMICHELLE L. KANE\r\n\r\nVeterans Law Judge\r\n\r\nBoard of Veterans’ Appeals\r\n\r\nAttorney for the Board\tC.
